# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator-APC-calculator-
A DSC(data structures)-based  Arbitrary Precision Calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of very large integers beyond the size limit of built-in data types (like int, long, long long). This project is implemented using Data Structures such as linked lists or dynamic arrays to handle numbers of unlimited size.
